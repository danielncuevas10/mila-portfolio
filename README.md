# Mila Tutoring

Mila Tutoring is a modern, responsive tutoring website built with Vite, TypeScript, HTML, and SCSS.
It presents a clean and professional online presence for a private Math and English teacher, designed to clearly communicate services, pricing, and contact information.

The site includes dedicated sections for:

- About the tutor

- Tutoring services

- Pricing plans

- Contact and inquiries

## Data-Driven Growth

To help the tutor grow their reach and engagement, I added Google Analytics. This allows the tutor to identify specific student niches and geographical interest points. By tracking these insights, the tutor can understand where their potential students are coming from and continuously refine the content to improve user engagement and conversion.

Everything about the site is designed to be easy to use. It’s built for speed and accessibility, working nicely across all devices—from mobile phones to tablets and desktops to make sure nothing stands in the way of a student getting the help they need.
